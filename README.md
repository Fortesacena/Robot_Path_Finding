## Problem Description
The task involves solving the path planning problem for a robot navigating through obstacles in a given environment. The problem statement includes:

Given:
A set of obstacles. 
A start point. 
An end point. 

Objective: 
Plan a path for a robot to move from the start point to the end point while avoiding the obstacles.

## Requirements
The application is designed to meet the following requirements:

Scalability: It should handle varying numbers of obstacles and complexities of the environment. 
Feasibility: The program should be able to find a feasible path for any given set of obstacles and start and end points.

## Algorithm
The implemented algorithm for solving the path planning problem is the A* Search Algorithm. This algorithm efficiently finds the shortest path from the start point to the end point while considering the obstacles in the environment.

## Implementation
The application is implemented using JavaScript. The source code is organized to handle the input of obstacles, start and end points, and to output a feasible path for the robot.

## Usage
To use the application, follow these steps:

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Clone this repository. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory. Run the application using the command: node index.js. Provide the necessary input when prompted, including the set of obstacles, start point, and end point. The program will output the feasible path for the robot to move from the start point to the end point while avoiding the obstacles.
